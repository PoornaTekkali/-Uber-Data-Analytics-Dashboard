ðŸš– Uber Data Analytics Project
ðŸ“Œ What This Project Does

This project takes raw Uber ride data and turns it into easy-to-read insights.
It shows patterns like:

When people take rides the most

Which days are the busiest

Interactive charts and dashboards you can explore

ðŸ’¡ Why I Built It

I wanted to learn how to work with real-world data from start to finish â€”
from cleaning messy files, to finding trends, and finally showing them in a way anyone can understand.

ðŸ›  Whatâ€™s Included

Clean data from messy CSV files

Charts & graphs showing ride patterns by hour and day

Interactive dashboard you can filter and explore

Database storage for processed data

Machine learning predictions for ride patterns

ðŸš€ How to Run It
Step 1: Install Requirements

Download or clone this project

Install Python (3.7 or newer)

Install needed packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Add Your Data

Put your Uber CSV files in the data/ folder

They should have at least:

DATE column (any format)

TIME column (any format)

Step 3: Process the Data

Run the scripts in this order:

python load_all_excel.py
python data_cleaning.py
python data_transformation.py

Step 4: Start the Dashboard
streamlit run uber_dashboard.py


Your browser will open at http://localhost:8501.

ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll See in the Dashboard

Total rides

Most popular hours & days

Interactive maps (if location data is available)

Filters for exploring certain dates or times

Charts that change based on your filters

ðŸ›  Common Issues & Fixes

"Data file not found" â†’ Run the data scripts first.

"Module not found" â†’ Install packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Dashboard is empty â†’ Check your CSV is in data/ and has DATE/TIME columns.

Dashboard wonâ€™t start â†’ Try another port:

streamlit run uber_dashboard.py --server.port 8502
